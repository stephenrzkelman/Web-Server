1. ordered
1. list
4. with bad numbering
    1. and a nested list
8. how about

- unordered list
    - and a nested item

* bullet list

+ again

- 1968\.

- what if we put

    a paragraph

- in the middle of a bullet list?

    > what about a blockquote?

- both of those work just fine

we can also do `inline code`
```
and code blocks with the triple back tick
```
    and code blocks with indenting
- it works in bulleted lists too:

        see?

- pretty cool, right?

And it supports images:  
![this is an image](image-link.jpg)

horizontal rules split the page

***
you can do them with asterisks, too!

and even underscores

We also got [links](image-link.jpg)

and easy email addresses <mbx@cs.ucla.edu> and easy urls <https://www.markdownguide.org>
unfortunately, we can't make the links reference-style

and we can have inline html like <b>this</b>
